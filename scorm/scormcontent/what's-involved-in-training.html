            	<h1>Training at Flemington</h1>
                <p>The first stage of a horse’s training is to “break-in”. This is when a horse is taught to be ridden. Some trainers conduct their own breaking-in, while others will send their horses to specialised horse breakers. In most cases, “break-in” occurs prior to being stabled at Flemington.</p>
                <p>A typical preparation will take around 12 weeks from the time a horse comes in from the paddock to when he goes for his first race. Watch the videos to discover what and who is involved in the training of a thoroughbred horse.</p>
